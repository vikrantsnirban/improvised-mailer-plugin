  Name of the mail server. Leave it empty to use the default server
  (which is normally the one running on localhost).

  Jenkins uses JavaMail for sending out e-mails, and JavaMail allows
  additional settings to be given as system properties to the container.
  See <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/javamail-properties">
  this document</a> for possible values and effects.
